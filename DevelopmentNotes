Well, I'm finally beginning this code project in earnest. Had a few setbacks this past week, but here we go.

First steps are to get the project started in github and intellij. When you haven't done something like this in a
 bit, it can get a little rusty. ;)

Well, I figure I better do the trains problem being that I'm coming from the railroad. It's only fitting after all.
Was tempted to do Roman Numerals, as I've done a similar kata a few times, but figured I'd do something new.

Ok - so I think of gotten so used to writing mostly in Groovy, that I forget how painful Java can be. It's really the
little things that make the difference, like not having to fuss about getting an integer from a string.
